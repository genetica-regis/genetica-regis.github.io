# Understanding Cannabinoids: Beyond THC and CBD

When most people think of cannabis compounds, they think of THC (gets you high) and CBD (doesn't get you high). But there's so much more to the story.

## The Major Cannabinoids

### THC (Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol)
The primary psychoactive compound. Beyond the "high," THC offers:
- Pain relief
- Anti-nausea effects
- Appetite stimulation
- Sleep aid (in the right dose)

### CBD (Cannabidiol)
Non-intoxicating and widely studied for:
- Anti-anxiety effects
- Anti-inflammatory properties
- Seizure reduction (FDA-approved for some conditions)
- Modulating THC's effects

### CBG (Cannabigerol)
The "mother cannabinoid" — all other cannabinoids derive from CBG-A. Research suggests:
- Antibacterial properties
- Potential for glaucoma treatment
- Anti-inflammatory effects

### CBN (Cannabinol)
Forms when THC degrades. Known for:
- Sedative effects
- Potential sleep aid
- Mild psychoactivity

### CBC (Cannabichromene)
Often overlooked but research indicates:
- Anti-inflammatory properties
- Potential antidepressant effects
- Works synergistically with other cannabinoids

## The Entourage Effect

This is crucial: cannabinoids work better together than in isolation. 

A strain with 15% THC, 2% CBD, rich terpenes, and minor cannabinoids often provides better therapeutic effects than a 25% THC isolate.

This is why we breed for **full-spectrum profiles**, not just high THC numbers.

## Why This Matters for Breeding

At Genetica Regis, we select for:
- Balanced cannabinoid ratios
- Presence of minor cannabinoids
- Consistent profiles across plants

Single-compound medicine has its place, but for many patients, the whole plant works better.

## Testing & Transparency

We advocate for full cannabinoid testing on all genetics. When choosing seeds, look for breeders who provide:
- Lab test results
- Parent lineage
- Cannabinoid predictions based on genetics
