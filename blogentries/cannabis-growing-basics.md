Growing your own cannabis at home can be incredibly rewarding — both medicinally and personally. Here's what I've learned from my journey.

> ⚠️ **Legal Notice:** Always check your local laws. This guide is for educational purposes in regions where home cultivation is legal.

## Why Grow Your Own?

- **Quality control** — You know exactly what goes into your medicine
- **Cost savings** — Initial investment pays off quickly
- **Strain selection** — Grow what works best for your needs
- **Therapeutic hobby** — Gardening is great for mental health

## Basic Requirements

### Space
You don't need much. Options include:
- Grow tent (2x2 or 4x4 feet)
- Spare closet
- Small room

### Equipment Checklist

```
[ ] Grow light (LED recommended)
[ ] Ventilation fan + carbon filter
[ ] Grow tent or enclosed space
[ ] Pots (fabric pots work great)
[ ] Soil or growing medium
[ ] Nutrients
[ ] pH meter
[ ] Timer for lights
```

### Light Schedule

- **Vegetative stage:** 18 hours on, 6 hours off
- **Flowering stage:** 12 hours on, 12 hours off

## My Setup

I run a simple 4x4 tent with:
- 240W LED (Samsung diodes)
- 6" inline fan with carbon filter
- Living soil in 7-gallon fabric pots

Keeps things simple and organic. The plants are happy, I'm happy.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overwatering** — #1 killer of new growers. Let soil dry between waterings.
2. **Poor ventilation** — Plants need fresh air. Don't skip the fan.
3. **Wrong pH** — Keep it between 6.0-7.0 for soil.
4. **Nutrient burn** — Less is more. Start at half strength.

## Medical Benefits

For me, cannabis helps with:
- Chronic pain management
- Sleep issues
- Anxiety relief

Everyone's different. Keep a journal of what strains/doses work for you.
