Happy New Year! Here's what's happening in the Genetica Regis garden.

## Current Projects

### CBD Critical Mass F2
We're in the second filial generation of our Critical Mass CBD project. The goal: stabilize a 1:1 THC:CBD ratio with the classic Critical Mass structure.

**Status:** 12 seeds germinated, 8 females identified. Selecting the best 3 for the next generation based on:
- Cannabinoid ratio (lab testing pending)
- Terpene profile (nose test: looking for sweet, earthy notes)
- Structure and vigor

### Autoflower Conversion: Northern Lights
Taking our Northern Lights cut through autoflower conversion. Generation 4 now showing ~95% auto traits while retaining the parent's sedative terpene profile.

**Expected release:** Late 2026

### High-CBG Experiment
Crossing a CBG-dominant male (White CBG) with our best relaxation-focused female (Purple Punch phenotype). First seeds harvested, will pop in spring.
